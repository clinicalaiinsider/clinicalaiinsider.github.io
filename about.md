## Hi, I'm DataGodzilla 👋

I'm a clinical informaticist and data scientist exploring the intersection of healthcare data and artificial intelligence. My work focuses on:

- **OHDSI Ecosystem** — Building with OMOP CDM, ATLAS, and the global network of observational health databases
- **Clinical NLP** — Extracting structured insights from unstructured clinical text using BioBERT and custom pipelines
- **Real-World Evidence** — Designing cohort studies and comparative effectiveness research

## Background

With a background in [your background here], I've spent [X years] working on healthcare data problems ranging from ETL pipelines to predictive modeling.

## This Blog

This site documents my learning journey through clinical informatics. Each post is a deep dive into a specific topic, with working code examples and practical insights.

**Topics I cover:**

- OMOP CDM and vocabulary mapping
- OHDSI tools (ATLAS, Achilles, WebAPI)
- Clinical NLP with transformers
- ETL patterns for healthcare data
- Cohort definition and phenotyping
